⚡ Electricity Billing System – C Language Project

📄 Description

The Electricity Billing System is a console-based C project that allows users to manage and generate electricity bills for multiple customers. This simple yet functional program demonstrates core programming concepts like arrays, structures, loops, conditionals, and functions in C.

It is designed to calculate the base amount based on units consumed, apply adjustments (like service charges or discounts), and display the final bill for each customer.

💡 Billing Logic

The billing system uses a tier-based rate system:

Units ≤ 100: ₹5.00 per unit

101–300: ₹7.00 per unit

> 300: ₹10.00 per unit




Additional charges or discounts can be applied based on custom logic or percentage values.
